"""
Spiral metrics (pure) — literature-standard movement-quality scoring for a
self-paced spiral trace. No camera, no UI; unit-tested against synthetic traces
in screening_tests/tests/test_spiral.py. See docs/tests/SPIRAL_TEST_PLAN.md §3.

Two scores decide the verdict, and the worse one wins (engine 4, see
ENGINE_VERSION below and docs/tests/SPIRAL_TEST_PLAN.md §3.4):
  accuracy_score            0-100 line accuracy from mean_dev_pct, the
                            swept-angle radial deviation as a % of the radius.
  tremor_score / tremor_pct robust 4-8 Hz fingertip oscillation as a % of the
                            radius (median amplitude, tracking jumps dropped).
Readings, saved but deciding nothing:
  sparc / smoothness_index  Spectral Arc Length (Balasubramanian et al., J
                            NeuroEng Rehabil 2015) of the speed profile. The
                            headline until engine 4.
  norm_jerk                 dimensionless jerk from the 2-D position path.
  vel_cv_pct                speed coefficient of variation (Schroter V-Rel 2003).
  tremor_power_frac         detrended-position 3.5-12 Hz band power (the
                            original bounded tremor readout).
  completion_pct            fraction of the template visited — a data-quality
                            GATE, not a score.

Jitter is measured on the *raw* (minimally filtered) fingertip: the One-Euro
smoothing used for display would erase it (docs/tests/SPIRAL_TEST_PLAN.md §3.1).

    normalized magnitude spectrum, adaptive amplitude cutoff, arc length.

    Engine 2: the adaptive cutoff is found above the tracker's noise floor.
    The speed of a webcam fingertip carries a flat (white) noise floor of
    ~1-3 % of the DC peak from ~1 Hz to Nyquist, and its random bumps reached
    the canonical 5 % threshold in about half of the recorded runs: one bump
    at 7 Hz stretched the arc across all the noise and turned a clean trace
    (mean deviation 3.5 %, no tremor) from -2.3 into -6.0, index 0. So the
    cutoff is now read off a lightly smoothed spectrum (`smooth_hz`), against
    `max(amp_th, noise_k * floor)` where the floor is the median of the upper
    half of the analysed band (a narrow tremor peak does not move a median).
    The arc itself is still measured on the unsmoothed spectrum. A real tremor
    of 2 px stands well clear of the floor and still pulls SPARC down (-2.1 ->
    -5.8 on a replayed run), which the old cutoff could not tell apart from no
    tremor at all. `fc` is also clamped to Nyquist: at 13 fps a 10 Hz

                scored as one trace, exactly as a run with a gap always has
                been. Scoring each clean stretch separately was tried and
                rejected: replaying 41 recorded runs with their bottom arcs
                blanked out, per-stretch SPARC landed a median 13 index points
                from the run's own clean score (short stretches bias it), the
                single bridged trace 3. None/[] leaves the input untouched.
