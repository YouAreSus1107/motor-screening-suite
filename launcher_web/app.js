   The bar used to sit across the bottom of every page permanently. It is a
   standing legal note, not a status line, so it now lives just below the
   viewport edge and rises while the pointer is in the strip it occupies.

   The zone is measured from the bar itself rather than hard-coded: a
   transform does not change the layout box, so offsetHeight is the bar's
   real height whether it is up or down, and the trigger is therefore exactly
   where the bar lands. Pointer position is read instead of a CSS :hover on
   an invisible catcher, so nothing transparent is sitting over the bottom of
   the page swallowing clicks.

   Touch has no hover at all, and this must stay reachable: the grabber is a
   real target and a tap pins the bar open. */
